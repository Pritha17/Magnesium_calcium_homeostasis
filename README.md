# About
This is the mathematical model of magnesium and calcium homeostasis and their regualtion by the calciotropic hormones, parathyroid hormone and calcitriol, in a male rat. The model was used to simulate the effect of (i) dietary magnesium deficiency, (ii) low/high dietary calcium in the presence of dietray magnesium deficiency, and (iii) calcitriol deficiency.

# Instructions
1. The magnesium_mod.m file contains all the equations and the params_male.txt file contains all the parameter values.
2. To simulate baseline steady state results, run the compute_SS.m file.
3. To simuate the effect dietary magnesium deficiency, run sim_IMg_deficiency.m file and to plot the results run Plots/figure_IMg_deficiency.m file.
4. To simuate the effect of low/high dietary calcium combined with dietary magnesium deficiency, run sim_IMg_ICa.m file and to plot the results run Plots/figure_IMg_ICa.m file.
5. To simuate the effect of calcitriol deficiency, run sim_25D_deficiency.m file and to plot the results run Plots/figure_25D_deficiency.m file.
